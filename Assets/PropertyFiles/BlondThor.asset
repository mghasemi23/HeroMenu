  Description: "Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history
    of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to
    the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high popularity during
    the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia,
    emblems of his hammer, Mj\xF6lnir, were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing
    the name of the god bear witness to his popularity. "
